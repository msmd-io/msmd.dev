So here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it.
I installed Oven Media Engine which kinda does all the hard work for you.</description></item><item><title>Wireless Neopixels With Esp32 and Artnet</title><link>https://msmd.dev/wireless-neopixels-with-esp32-and-artnet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 20:09:44 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://msmd.dev/wireless-neopixels-with-esp32-and-artnet/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s how to set up ESP32 devices as a wireless access point, Art-Net server and Art-Net Nodes, to control neo-pixels wirelessly with DMX.
These are the devices we&amp;rsquo;ll be coding:
ESP32 Access Point [Github] - creates the Art-Net wireless network. ESP32 Art-Net Node [Github] - connects to the ESP32 Access Point and receives DMX data, which it sends to connected neopixels. ESP32 Art-Net Server [Github] - connects to the ESP32 Access Point and sends DMX data to the ESP32 Nodes.</description></item><item><title>Teensy Audio Streaming with JackTrip</title><link>https://msmd.dev/teensy-audio-streaming-with-jacktrip/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 20:07:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://msmd.dev/teensy-audio-streaming-with-jacktrip/</guid><description>Get the code on GitHub.
I&amp;rsquo;ve written some code that lets you use your Teensy 4.1 as a JackTrip client using a Teensy 4.1 + Audio Shield + Ethernet connector. You can optionally connect a small colour LED display to show some info such as the Teensy&amp;rsquo;s IP Address and whether it&amp;rsquo;s receiving/transmitting data.
The remote JackTrip device&amp;rsquo;s IP address must be input using the serial monitor. However, this IP address is stored in the EPROM of the Teensy so if the IP address is static you only have to set it once and it will autoconnect after 10 seconds on future boots.</description></item></channel></rss>
